## Installation

This bundle requires at least Symfony 3.0.

You can use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install api-client-bundle:
```bash
composer require chaplean/api-client-bundle
```

Then add to your AppKernel.php:
```php
new EightPoints\Bundle\GuzzleBundle\EightPointsGuzzleBundle(),
new Chaplean\Bundle\ApiClientBundle\ChapleanApiClientBundle(),

// If you want to enable Database logging
new Doctrine\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\DoctrineBundle(),

// If you want to enable Email logging
new Symfony\Bundle\SwiftmailerBundle\SwiftmailerBundle(),
new Symfony\Bundle\TwigBundle\TwigBundle()
```

## Creating bundles based on api-client-bundle

This section describes how you can create your own api bundle based on this project. If you want examples see our own api bundles on [packagist](https://packagist.org/?query=chaplean%2F%20client-bundle) or [github](https://github.com/chaplean?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=client-bundle&type=&language=).

### Configuration

First you will need to configure guzzlehttp that we use under the hood to perform the actual http
requests. See the [bundle](https://github.com/8p/EightPointsGuzzleBundle) documentation or the [library](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/request-options.html) documentation for the full range
of options.

config.yml:
```yaml
eight_points_guzzle:
    logging: true
    clients:
        fake_api:
            # We inject guzzle configuration from parameters.yml but we could hardcode it here
            options: %fake_api.options%
```

You will also probably want to create some custom parameters.

parameters.yml:
```yaml
parameters:
    # Guzzle configuration
    fake_api.options:
        timeout: 10
        verify: false
        expect: false

    # Your custom configuration, here we just define the base url of our fake_api
    fake_api.url: 'http://fakeapi.com/'
```

As you inject guzzle in your Api class you can have different configuration per Api. See next [section](#creating-api).

### Creating an Api class

To use api-client-bundle you have to create a class extending AbstractApi. You can create any number of classes extending AbstractApi and have all of them using different
configurations via dependency injection.

```php
<?php

use Chaplean\Bundle\ApiClientBundle\Api\AbstractApi;
use Chaplean\Bundle\ApiClientBundle\Api\Parameter;
use GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface;

class FakeApi extends AbstractApi
{
    protected $url;

    /**
     * AbstractApi requires you to pass it a GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface and an EventDispatcherInterface,
	 * we also inject the base api of our fake_api
     */
    public function __construct(ClientInterface $client, EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher, $url)
    {
        $this->url = $url;

        // buildApi() is called automatically by the parent constructor, make sure you call it at the END of the construct() function.
        parent::__construct($client, $eventDispatcher);
    }

    /**
     * We define our api here, we'll dig into this in the next section
     */
    public function buildApi()
    {
        $this->globalParameters()
            ->urlPrefix($this->url) // here we set base url
            ->expectsJson();

        $this->get('fake_get', 'fake')
            ->urlParameters([
                'id' => Parameter::id(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

```yaml
services:
    App\Bundle\ApiBundle\Api\FakeApi:
        arguments:
            $client: '@guzzle.client.fake_api' # Guzzle client we defined in config.yml
            $url:    '%fake_api.url%'          # the base url of fake_api
```

And we're done! We could repeat this process to create another Api with completely different configurations.

#### Defining an Api

Let's focus on the ```buildApi()``` function you have to fill in and what we can do in it.
The role of this function is to define your Api using the api-client-bundle's api:

```php
<?php

public function buildApi()
{
    /*
     * You have to call this function first to set basic config
     */
    $this->globalParameters()
        ->urlPrefix('http://some.url/')  // set the base url of our api

    /*
     * We can then set some configurations that will be the default for every route we create later.
     * You have the exact same api available here and available when configuring routes.
     * See route definition for detailed descriptions of headers(), urlParameters(), queryParameters() and requestParameters()
     */
        ->expectsPlain()                 // Declare we expect responses to be plain text
        ->expectsJson()                  // Declare we expect responses to be json
        ->expectsXml()                   // Declare we expect responses to be xml

        ->sendFormUrlEncoded()           // Configure that we post our data as classic form url encoded
        ->sendJson()                     // Configure that we post our data as json
        ->sendXml()                      // Configure that we post our data as xml
        ->sendJSONString()               // Configure that we post our data as a url-encoded key-value pair where the key is JSONString and the value is the request data in json format

        ->headers([])                    // Configure what headers we send
        ->urlParameters([])              // Configure what url placeholders we define
        ->queryParameters([])            // Configure what query strings we send
        ->requestParameters([]);         // Configure what post data we send

    /*
     * Here we define the core of our api, the routes. We can use get(), post(), put(), patch(), delete() functions
     * with a route name and a route url (with placeholders in you want) to define routes.
     */
    $this->get('query_one', 'data/{id}');
    $this->post('create_one', 'data');
    $this->patch('update_one', 'data/{id}');
    $this->put('update_one', 'data/{id}');
    $this->delete('delete_one', 'data/{id}');

    /*
     * Those function return the route object to further configure it.
     * As said previously the route api is the same as the one we get with globalParameters().
     */
    $this->post('create_one', 'data/{id}')
        ->expectsPlain()                 // Declare we expect responses to be plain text
        ->expectsJson()                  // Declare we expect responses to be json
        ->expectsXml()                   // Declare we expect responses to be xml

        ->sendFormUrlEncoded()           // Configure that we post our data as classic form url encoded
        ->sendJson()                     // Configure that we post our data as json
        ->sendXml()                      // Configure that we post our data as xml
        ->sendJSONString()               // Configure that we post our data as a url-encoded key-value pair where the key is JSONString and the value is the request data in json format

        ->headers([])                    // Configure what headers we send
        ->urlParameters([])              // Configure what url placeholders we define
        ->queryParameters([])            // Configure what query strings we send
        ->requestParameters([]);         // Configure what post data we send

    /*
     * Finally calling headers(), urlParameters(), queryParameters() or requestParameters() without configuring parameters is sort of useless.
     * So let's see how to define parameters.
     */
    $this->put('update_data', 'data/{id}')
        ->urlParameters(                 // Define the placeholder parameter for the {id} in the url
            [
                'id' => Parameter::id(),
            ]
        )
    /*
     * We define a list of key => values pairs where key is the name of the parameter and the value is a parameter type.
     * We can also configure the parameters type. They all support at least optional(), defaultValue().
     */
        ->requestParameters(
            [
                'name'     => Parameter::string(),
                'birthday' => Parameter::dateTime('Y-m-d'),
                'is_human' => Parameter::bool()->defaultValue(true),
                'height'   => Parameter::int(),
                'weight'   => Parameter::float()->optional(),
                'tags'     => Parameter::object(
                    [
                        'id'   => Parameter::id(),
                        'name' => Parameter::string(),
                    ]
                ),
                'friends'  => Parameter::arrayList(Parameter::id()),
                'enum'     => Parameter::enum(['foo', 'bar']),
            ]
        );
    /*
     * Last but not least, you can also directly give any instance of Parameter. Here we use ArrayParameter.
     */
        ->requestParameters(Parameter::arrayList(
            Parameter::object(
                [
                    'id'     => Parameter::id()
                ]
            )
        ))

    /*
     * Passing an array is actually a shortcut that implies ObjectParameter since it's the most common.
     * 
     * The following two definitions are equivalent.
     */
        ->requestParameters(
            [
                'id'     => Parameter::id()
            ]
        )

        ->requestParameters(Parameter::object(
            [
                'id'     => Parameter::id()
            ]
        ));
}
```

## Using a bundle based on api-client-bundle

This section describes how to use a bundle based api-client-bundle.

As shown in the previous [section](#defining-an-api) the api defines a list of routes and the parameters they accept. To call a route you need to provide them.

For an api with the following definition:

```php
class FakeApi
{
    ...

    public function buildApi()
    {
        $this->get('user', '/user/{id}')
            ->urlParameters(['id' => Parameter::id()])
            ->expectsJson()
    }

    ...
}
```

We can call the `getUser()` method, provide the parameters and run the request:
```php
$response = $api->getUser()           // the get('user', '/user/{id}') definition added a getUser() method
    ->bindUrlParameters(['id' => 42]) // we provide a value for the 'id' parameter
    ->exec();                         // we can now execute the request
```

Here we called `bindUrlParameters()` to provide values for the parameters defined with `urlParameters()`. Similarly, for parameters defined with `headers()`, `queryParameters()` and `requestParameters()` there is a `bindHeaders()`, `bindQueryParameters()` and `bindRequestParameters()`.

You have to call these functions with a `key => value` array. There is a validation pass during `exec()` before running the request making sure the values you provided match the definitions in the api.

Finally, `exec()` returns a `ResponseInterface`. Several implementations of this interface exist:
* InvalidParameterResponse: The parameters provided didn't weren't valid;
* RequestFailedResponse: Request performed but failed (network issue or non 2xx status code);
* PlainResponse: Request suceeded and route was either defined with `expectsPlain()` or it wasn't specified;
* JsonResponse: Request suceeded and route was defined with `expectsJson()`;
* XmlResponse: Request suceeded and route was defined with `expectsXml()`;

Among the functions in `ResponseInterface` here are some usefull ones and how you could use them:
```php
if ($response->succeeded()) {                 // Was the response a 2xx?
    // The request suceeded.
    $content = $response->getContent();       // Get the body of the response,
                                              // will be a string for plain text
                                              // and associative array for json and xml.
    ...
} else {
    $violations = $response->getViolations(); // If the provided parameters were invalid.
                                              // this will contain the violations.
    if (!empty($violations)) {
        // The request failed because of invalid parameters.
        ...
    } else {
        // The request failed due to a network issue or the response was not a 2xx.
        ...
    }
}

```

## Additional Features

This bunde expose some configuration if you want to enable extra features. You can enable database and / or email logging of requests.
To use the database or email loggers you will have to setup respectively [doctrine](https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html) or [swiftmailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/email.html) in your project.
The default configuraton is:

config.yml:
```yaml
chaplean_api_client:
    enable_database_logging: false
    enable_email_logging: false
    email_logging:
        # Limit emails to the specified codes.
        # You can either use a code directly like 200, 404, ...
        # or use XX to say all codes in the familly like 5XX to say all server errors.
        # 0 means that the request failed to run (either because of invalid parameters or a networking error)
        codes_listened: ['0', '1XX', '2XX', '3XX', '4XX', '5XX']
        address_from: ~
        address_to:   ~
```

You can override the default email content by overriding the translation keys or even the email body twig template.
The translation keys are under `chaplean_api_client.email.request_executed_notification` and the template is `Resources/views/Email/request_executed_notification.txt.twig`.

## Versioning

api-client-bundle follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). In short the scheme is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where
1. MAJOR is bumped when there is a breaking change,
2. MINOR is bumped when a new feature is added in a backward-compatible way,
3. PATCH is bumped when a bug is fixed in a backward-compatible way.

Versions bellow 1.0.0 are considered experimental and breaking changes may occur at any time.
